ALGORITHM used in Formant frequency detection 
•	Read a audio wave file using soundfile library function
•	Plot the time domain original speech signal 
•	Divide the speech signal into Hamming windowed frames using enframe function.
•	Perform the DFT Operation on signal and convert it into frequency domain signal. 
•	Extract the each frame from the signal . 
•	The following operations are to be done framewise:
•	Compute the (log) magnitude spectrum of the frame.
•	Smoothen the spectrum using by performing LPC analysis using librosa library function.
•	Use a peak-picking algorithm to pick the peaks .
